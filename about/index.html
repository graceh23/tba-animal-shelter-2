        <h2> About TBA</h2>
        <p>
            The Better Animal Association (TBA) is a non-profit shelter dedicated to giving every animal a second chance at life. Located in Portsmouth, we specialize in caring for dogs, cats, and small animals â€” including those with special needs.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to provide a safe, loving environment for homeless and abandoned animals while working tirelessly to find them forever homes. Our staff and volunteers believe every animal matters, no matter their age, breed, or background.
        </p>
        <p>
